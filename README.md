A collection of page scans and corresponding text files of Latin.

These files are designed for use in testing OCR quality, using the tools from https://gitorious.org/ancient-greek-training-for-tesseract/ocr-evaluation-tools, in particular the `tessaccsummary` script.

The naming of the files is quite straightforward:

 * `<name>.png` - the page scan
 * `<name>.txt` - the correct UTF-8 encoded text corresponding to the page scan
 * `<name>.src` - a text file describing the provenance of the page scan
